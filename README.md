Advent of Code Solutions

Hey All!

Here you will find solutions to some Advent of Code puzzles.

Python was truly the language that I was using when programming finally "clicked". You'll find the Python folder is the largest in terms of solutions.

The other languages are solving puzzles 2021: Day1, Day2, and Day3. I've refractored these three solutions in several languages to prove adaptability as an aspiring developer. While only three solutions may not prove proficiency in a language, it does prove that I can learn the syntax of different languages in a manageable amount of time. For instance, I learned bash syntax well enough to refractor the three solutions in one morning/afternoon; about 4-5 hours.

Please take a look through and tell me what you think:D
